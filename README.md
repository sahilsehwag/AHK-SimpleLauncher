## Introduction
A simple launcher written in _AHK script_ that executes _CLI_ commands in current explorer directory. I generally used it for creating, renaming, moving files using CLI tools or opening _**Command Prompt**_ in current explorer directory. Now better solutions exist but If you like a _**minimalistic**_, _**fancy**_ looking command bar to execute _**CLI**_ commands in explorer's current directory, This is good alternative.
Now It is a part of **[AHK-VimifiedExplorer](https://github.com/sahilsehwag/AHK-SimpleLauncher)** . See **[this](https://github.com/sahilsehwag/AHK-SimpleLauncher)**  project, If you want to be _productive_ in Windows Explorer or loves 😍 _**VIM**_ 😍 and finding ways to use VIM everywhere 😆.
